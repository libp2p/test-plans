# libp2p performance benchmarking

This project includes the following components:

- `terraform/`: a Terraform scripts to provision infrastructure
- `impl/`: implementations of the [libp2p perf protocol](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/pull/478) running on top of e.g. go-libp2p, rust-libp2p or Go's std-library https stack
- `runner/`: a set of scripts building and running the above implementations on the above infrastructure, reporting the results in `benchmark-results.json`

Benchmark results can be visualized with https://observablehq.com/@mxinden-workspace/libp2p-perf.

## Provision infrastructure

### Bootstrap

1. Save your public SSH key as the file `./terraform/modules/short_lived/files/perf.pub`; or generate a new key pair with `make ssh-keygen` and add it to your SSH agent with `make ssh-add`.
2. `cd terraform/configs/local`
3. `terraform init`
4. `terraform apply`
5. `CLIENT_IP=$(terraform output -raw client_ip)`
6. `SERVER_IP=$(terraform output -raw server_ip)`

## Build and run implementations

_WARNING_: Running the perf tests might take a while.

1. `cd runner`
2. `npm ci`
3. `npm run start -- --client-public-ip $CLIENT_IP --server-public-ip $SERVER_IP`

## Deprovision infrastructure

1. `cd terraform/configs/local`
2. `terraform destroy`

## Adding a new implementation

1. Add implementation to `impl/`. Requirements for the binary:
  - Running as a libp2p-perf server
    - Command line flags
      - `--run-server`
      - `--secret-key-seed` unsigned integer to be used as a seed by libp2p-based implementations. Likely to go away in future iterations.
  - Running as a libp2p-perf client
      - Input via command line
        - `--server-ip-address`
        - `--transport` (see `runner/versions.ts` for possible variants)
        - `--upload-bytes` number of bytes to upload per stream.
        - `--download-bytes` number of bytes to upload per stream.
      - Output
        - Logging MUST go to stderr.
        - Measurement output is printed to stdout as JSON in the form of:
          ```json
          {"connectionEstablishedSeconds":0.246442851,"uploadSeconds":0.000002077,"downloadSeconds":0.060712241}
          ```

2. Reference implementation in `runner/src/versions.ts`.
