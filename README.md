This repository contains interoperability and end to end tests for libp2p modules across different implementations and versions.

## Specs

Please see our first specification for interoperability tests between transports, multiplexers, and secure channels here: [Interoperability Test Specs](https://github.com/libp2p/test-plans/blob/master/multidim-interop/README.md)

More specs to come soon!

## History

These test-plans historically used Testground. To read why we're now using `docker compose` instead please see: [Why we're moving away from Testground](https://github.com/libp2p/test-plans/issues/103)

## Roadmap

Our roadmap for test-plans can be found here: https://github.com/libp2p/test-plans/blob/master/ROADMAP.md

It represents current projects the test-plans maintainers are focused on and provides an estimation of completion targets.
It is complementary to those of [go-libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/blob/master/ROADMAP.md), [rust-libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/blob/master/ROADMAP.md), [js-libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/blob/master/ROADMAP.md), and the [overarching libp2p project roadmap](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/ROADMAP.md).
