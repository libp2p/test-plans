This repository contains:
* interoperability tests for libp2p's transport layers modules across different implementations and versions
* components to run performance benchmarks for different libp2p implementations

## Transport Interop
### Specs

Please see our first specification for interoperability tests between transports, multiplexers, and secure channels here: [Transport Interoperability Test Specs](transport-interop/README.md)

More specs to come soon!

## History

These test-plans historically used Testground. To read why we're now using `docker compose` instead please see: [Why we're moving away from Testground](https://github.com/libp2p/test-plans/issues/103)

## Performance Benchmarking

Please see the [benchmarking README](./perf#libp2p-performance-benchmarking).

## Roadmap

Our roadmap for test-plans can be found here: https://github.com/libp2p/test-plans/blob/master/ROADMAP.md

It represents current projects the test-plans maintainers are focused on and provides an estimation of completion targets.
It is complementary to those of [go-libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/blob/master/ROADMAP.md), [rust-libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/blob/master/ROADMAP.md), [js-libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/blob/master/ROADMAP.md), and the [overarching libp2p project roadmap](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/ROADMAP.md).
